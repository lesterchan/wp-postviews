### To Display Updating View Count With LiteSpeed Cache
Use: `<div id="postviews_lscwp"></div>` to replace `<?php if(function_exists('the_views')) { the_views(); } ?>`.
NOTE: The id can be changed, but the div id and the ajax function must match.
Replace the ajax query in `wp-content/plugins/wp-postviews/postviews-cache.js` with

```javascript
jQuery.ajax({
    type:"GET",
    url:viewsCacheL10n.admin_ajax_url,
    data:"postviews_id="+viewsCacheL10n.post_id+"&action=postviews",
    cache:!1,
    success:function(data) {
        if(data) {
            jQuery('#postviews_lscwp').html(data+' views');
        }
   }
});
```

Purge the cache to use the updated pages.

### To Get Views With REST API
You can obtain the number of post views by adding `views` to your `_fields` parameter:
`/wp/v2/posts?_fields=views,title`
